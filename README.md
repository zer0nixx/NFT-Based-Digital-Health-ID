Digital Health ID - Aptos Smart Contract
A blockchain-based solution for secure and private digital health identification using Aptos Move.

Overview
This smart contract provides a decentralized approach to managing digital health IDs on the Aptos blockchain. Rather than storing sensitive medical information directly on-chain, the system uses cryptographic hashes to reference off-chain data while maintaining privacy and security.

Features
Secure Digital Health IDs: Create unique health identifiers linked to patient addresses
Privacy-Preserving: Sensitive health data remains off-chain, referenced via secure hashes
Access Control: Only patients and authorized providers can update health records
Tamper-Evident: All record changes are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain
Minimal Design: Simple yet effective implementation in under 50 lines of code
Smart Contract Structure
The contract consists of two main functions:

create_health_id: Creates a new digital health ID for a patient
update_health_record: Updates an existing health record (restricted to authorized parties)
Technical Implementation
The HealthRecord resource contains:

A unique identifier for the health record
A cryptographic hash of the health data (stored off-chain)
Timestamps for creation and updates
List of authorized provider addresses
Usage
Prerequisites
Aptos CLI
Move compiler
Deployment
Clone this repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aptos-health-id.git
cd aptos-health-id
Compile the contract
bash
aptos move compile
Deploy to Aptos blockchain
bash
aptos move publish
Using the Contract
After deployment, interact with the contract using the Aptos CLI or SDK:

Creating a Health ID
bash
aptos move run \
  --function-id 'YOUR_ADDRESS::DigitalHealthID::create_health_id' \
  --args 'string:RECORD_ID' 'string:DATA_HASH'
Updating a Health Record
bash
aptos move run \
  --function-id 'YOUR_ADDRESS::DigitalHealthID::update_health_record' \
  --args 'address:PATIENT_ADDRESS' 'string:NEW_DATA_HASH'
Security Considerations
The contract uses access control to ensure only authorized parties can update records
No sensitive health information is stored on-chain
Data hashes provide tamper-evident verification without compromising privacy
Potential Use Cases
Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems
Cross-border health data sharing
Patient-controlled health information
Healthcare provider authentication
Insurance claim verification
Future Enhancements
Add functionality to manage authorized providers
Implement tiered access controls for different data types
Add emergency access provisions
Extend with consent management features
Integrate with off-chain storage solutions
